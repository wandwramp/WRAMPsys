WRAMP was originally written in VHDL by Dean Armstrong in 2002 as part of an undergraduate
degree at the University of Waikato.

WRAMP was rewritten into WRAMPsys in Verilog for use with the Basys3 boards by 
Daniel Oosterwijk & Tyler Marriner in 2018 at the University of Waikato on behalf 
of WAND.
